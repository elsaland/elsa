Elsa is a _minimal_, _fast_ and _secure_ runtime for Javascript and Typescript written in Go, leveraging the power from [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/).

### Features

- URL based imports.
- No fs, net access unless specified.
- Compliant to web standards.
- Supports TypeScript.
- Module caching.
- Bundle your script into a single file.
- Create a standalone executable for your bundles.

### Coming up

- HTTP server, more Web APIs
- Easy installation scripts
- Standard modules

### Install

Not yet released, [build from source](#build-from-source) instead.

### Build from source

You will need Go installed on your machine before building.

Install go-bindata using `go get github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata/...`

Clone the repo on your `$GOPATH` and run `make build` to trigger the build process.

### Getting Started

Try running a simple program:

```typescript
// hello.ts
import { hello } from "https://x.nest.land/arweave-hello@0.0.2/mod.ts";

hello("Elsa");
```

```shell script
> elsa run hello.ts
Hello, Elsa
```

### FAQs

**Why choose QuickJS over V8?**

QuickJS is a small and embeddable Javascript engine but it lacks V8's JIT for fast JavaScript execution. Although, it doesn't mean you cannot use Elsa on backends and CPU intensive tasks.

QuickJS has a better startup time than V8 so it would be a strong alternative for CLI apps and short-lived runs.

**Looks like a QuickJS wrapper to me?**

Technically, Node and Deno are also V8 wrappers. All do the same job, init engine - init ops - bundle - run. Most people don't realise that implementing native ops is what makes a _runtime_ and not an _interpreter_.

**What's the status of the project?**

It is in it's _very early stages_ of development i.e. nothing should be considered stable. Feel free to take it for a spin though :)

**What does "minimal" actually refer to?**

The goal is to fullfil the _bare minimum_ requirements needed for development of a project. Elsa, although aims to be extendable via _plugins_. A few examples of features that are not likely to be included in Elsa are tools for formatting, linting and analysis.

In short, develop - package - ship
